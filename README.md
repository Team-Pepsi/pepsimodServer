# pepsimodServer

features: works

while hacky, this code actually works, unlike [the client](https://github.com/Team-Pepsi/pepsimodLauncher). it's nothing outstanding, it's not some miracle code, it's simply functional. keeping this here for posterity as well, in case anyone decides to try and revive the launcher.
